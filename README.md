# GETTING LEAGUE PROCESS SHIT WITH WIN32
```python
# FIRST WE GET WINDOW HNDW (int)
hndw = win32gui.FindWindow(None, "League of Legends")

# THEN WE GET THREAD ID AND PROCESS ID
(thread_id, process_id) = win32process.GetWindowThreadProcessId(hndw)
```

# HACKING LCA
```bash
WMIC PROCESS WHERE name='LeagueClientUx.exe' GET commandline
```

# BUILDING .EXE

WHITHOUT CUSOTOM FONT JSON(USING ONE THAT CUSTOMTKINTER ALREADY PROVIDES)
```bash
pyinstaller.exe -F main.py --collect-all customtkinter
```

# PS
CTK DOES NOT ALLOW `HIDE_TO_TRAY` SO WE ALWAYS HIDE TO TASKBAR

VERY SMALL RAM/MEMORY OPTIMIZATION CAN BE DONE IN OUTFRAME MAKE() BUT NOT WORTH
THE EFFORT TO CONCEPTUALIZE RN

# TODO
- BUILDING OF CONFIG PACKAGE!!!! üëç

- MIGRATE TO CUSTOMTKINTER AND REFACTOR WHOLE GUI PROGRAMMIGN üëç

- MAKE UTILITY FUNCT TO CREATE GUI WITHOUT BOILERPLATE Code 

IDEA: MAKE A STATIC FUNCTION INSIDE EACH FRAME THAT RETURNS A NEW INSTANCE OF FRAME

OR: MAKE A HELPER FUNCTION INSIDE EACH FRAMES FILE THAT RETURNS AN INSTANCE OF FRAME

- INCLUDE EMPTY JSON FIX IN `Config.fix_files`

- MAKE ASSETSD OR SMTH FOLDER TO NOT CLUTTER ROOT DIR:

- IMPLEMENT STOP KEYBIND/FLAG ON BACKGROUND_THREAD.PYüëç

- SMALL OPTIMIZATION WITH REGEX PROCESSING IN LEAUGE CONNECTION

- IMPLEMENT ZOOMED INITIALIZATION AS AN OPTION

- OFFLINE STATUS

- CLEAR CHALENGES MANIPULATIONüëç

- ICON/PROFILE BANNER/PROFILE RANK MANIPULATION WITH HTTP REQUESTS

- INGAME DLL INJECTED SKIN CHANGER? | IF NOT OUTGAME SKINCHANGER *BUT RAM OFFSTETS ARE ANNOYING*, MAYBE NO SKINCHANGER

- DRAWINGS? (CHECK RIOT TOS)

- EXTERNAL SPACEGLIDER (CHECK RIOT TOS) ALSO *RAM OFFSETS ARE ANNOYING*

- EXPLORE LOCALHOST INGAMGE API

# BEFORE COMMIT CHECKLIST
- GOOGLE DOCING
- LOGGING PROCESSES?????
